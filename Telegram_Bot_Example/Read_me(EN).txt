Hello!

Good time of day to those reading this resume.

A file named "Read_me" will accompany you throughout my repository, aiding in better navigation through each folder. 

It is available in two language versions:

- Read_me(EN): A file in English, reflecting my proficiency in the language and which you are currently reading. 
               
               I apologize in advance for any errors, and occasionally, I use Google Translate.

- Read_me(RU): A file in Russian.

Feel free to choose either of them at your discretion.


At present, my repository comprises examples of my work on Kaggle, organized into folders with descriptive names:

- Classification_Example: Completed projects addressing classification tasks (determining object classes).

- Regression_Example: Projects focusing on regression tasks (predicting precise values for each observation).

- xMy_Experiments: A folder showcasing my experiments, where you can observe my learning process from mistakes. 
                   Please, be lenient in judgment regarding the code in this folder.
