Hello!!!

First of all - Good day to you, who is reading this!

A file with this name will guide you throughout whole my repository
and will help me better navigate you to each of my folders.
It is available in two language variants:

Read_me(EN) - File in English.
              (Which you are reading now.
               It also shows my English level and, sometimes, my ability to use Google translator.
               also I apologize for my English).
              
Read_me(RU) - File in Russian.
              

Choose any of them as you wish.



At this moment my repository contains examples of my works with kaggle,
which are divided into folders with self-explanatory names:

Classification_Example - Folder with my completed work on classification tasks
                         (at the output we get object classes)

Regression_Example - Folder with my completed work on regression tasks
                     (at the output we get the exact number for each observation)

xMy_Experiments - Folder with my experiments
                  (As some people can says: "On mistakes we learn".
                   Thats why, perhaps, you will be interested to observe what I studied,
                   but please don't judge me strictly for the code in this folder)
